## Notes
Took me a while to figure out how I want to implement everything, I found myself coding then deleting and trying another way that might be more efficient overall used a lot of planning. I struggled with the data binding and opening the screen. all the functinality doesn'y work for this reason, My progress also got deleted while trying to push to github and I encountered different bugs the second time around with not being able to spend to much time on it.
